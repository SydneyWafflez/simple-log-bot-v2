#   Simple Log Bot v2


This is a log project I did when I was just learning JavaScript for the second time. It is a small bot that logs messages sent in chat. It logs who said what in what channel. A normal person wouldn't have a use for it, but why not, it is a fun little project. I suppose it can be useful to see what people are talking about if Discord is blocked (but for some reason the Discord API isn't)

- Lists Channel Name
- Lists Username
- List timestamp
- Custom version of Neofetch in chat (bc why not!)

If you want to help support this funny little project, any donos would be appreciated!
